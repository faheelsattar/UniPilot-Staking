2) Send 200000000000000000 to Stakeable contract
totalSupplyOfXpilot = 100000000000000000;
balance of Stakeable contrac = 300000000000000000;

3) Stake again
Amount to stake = 200000000000000000;
totalSupplyOfXpilot = 100000000000000000;
balance of Stakeable contract for pilot = 1100000000000000000;
ratio = 1100000000000000000/100000000000000000 = 11
mint(11 * 200000000000000000) = 600000000000000000
